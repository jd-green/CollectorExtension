# Project Requirements Document for Chrome Extension: Web Page Metadata Sender

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about creating a simple Chrome extension to quickly send the current web page's URL and some basic metadata (date, time, device info) to a pre-configured webhook when a user clicks on the extension's icon. The extension is designed so that each instance (each having its own unique icon and configuration) works independently. This helps users set up different webhooks easily and distinguish between them using custom icons.

The extension is being built to offer a lightweight, no-fuss solution for users who need to capture and forward metadata without diving into complicated settings or heavy technical tools. Its key objectives are to be easy to set up, provide clear visual feedback when data is sent, and support multiple configurations running at the same time in a single browser. Success is measured by the extension’s responsiveness, its seamless user experience, and the accuracy of data delivery via configurable webhooks.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A Chrome extension using Manifest V3.
*   Functionality to capture the current URL and metadata (date, time, and basic device information) when the extension icon is clicked.
*   The ability to support multiple independent instances within the same browser.
*   A configuration (options) page accessible via right-click, allowing users to upload a custom icon and input a webhook URL for each instance.
*   Visual feedback through a temporary badge (green checkmark for success and red X for failure) that displays for 10 seconds.
*   A retry mechanism that attempts to resend data up to three times if sending fails, then notifies the user with basic troubleshooting details.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Capturing additional metadata beyond the URL, date, time, and basic device info (like browser type or operating system details).
*   Advanced backend functions or server-side storage—only local storage is used.
*   Complex multi-webhook configurations per instance (each instance supports only one webhook URL).
*   Extensive error logging or persistent error state management beyond the basic retry and user notification.
*   Any feature that would require permissions beyond URL and storage access.

## 3. User Flow

When a user first installs the extension, they see the default appearance that prompts them to configure the extension through its options page. The user accesses this options page by right-clicking the extension icon, where they find a simple interface to upload a custom icon and enter a webhook URL. This configuration sets up a standalone instance of the extension, and the selected icon will represent that instance in the Chrome toolbar.

Once configured, the extension appears in the browser toolbar with the custom icon. When the user clicks their extension icon, the extension captures the current page’s URL along with the specified metadata (date, time, device info) and sends it to the configured webhook. The user then sees immediate visual feedback: a temporary badge (green checkmark for success or a red X to indicate failure) is displayed on the icon for 10 seconds. If the request fails, the repeated retry mechanism engages; after three unsuccessful attempts, the user is notified with additional information to help with troubleshooting.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Metadata Capture and Transmission:**

    *   Automatically capture the current URL and basic metadata (date, time, device info) when the extension icon is clicked.
    *   Send the captured data to a pre-configured webhook.

*   **Multiple Instance Support:**

    *   Allow multiple instances of the extension to run simultaneously in the same browser.
    *   Each instance is represented by a custom uploaded icon, and each has its own single webhook configuration.

*   **Configuration Options Page:**

    *   Provide an accessible options page (via right-click on the icon) where users can upload a custom icon and set their webhook URL.
    *   Save configuration settings in local storage to ensure persistence between sessions.

*   **Visual Feedback & Retry Mechanism:**

    *   Display a temporary badge (green checkmark on success, red X on failure) on the extension icon for 10 seconds.
    *   Implement a retry mechanism that attempts to send data up to 3 times on failure, followed by user notification with troubleshooting details.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   Vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript.
    *   Developed as a Chrome extension using Manifest V3.

*   **Backend & Storage:**

    *   No dedicated backend server; uses local storage for configuration settings like webhook URLs and custom icons.

*   **Additional Tools & Integrations:**

    *   Service workers provided by Manifest V3 for background processing, ensuring efficient handling of background tasks.
    *   IDE integration with tools like Cursor for real-time code suggestions (as needed).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The extension should quickly capture metadata and send it with minimal delay.
    *   Visual feedback (badge) must be rendered within moments and remain visible for 10 seconds.

*   **Security & Privacy:**

    *   Minimize permissions by requesting only URL and storage access.
    *   Make use of Manifest V3 to leverage enhanced security features.
    *   Ensure data handling does not compromise user privacy.

*   **Usability:**

    *   The configuration and options page must be simple, clear, and easy to navigate.
    *   Provide clear visual cues (via the icon badge) to confirm success or indicate errors.

*   **Reliability:**

    *   The retry mechanism must reliably attempt data transmission up to 3 times upon failure.
    *   User notifications should clearly indicate a failure after retries are exhausted.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The extension relies on Manifest V3, meaning it must work within the constraints and guidelines established by Chrome’s extension framework.
*   Local storage is used exclusively for saving configuration settings, implying that configurations are tied to the browser and are not synced across different devices.
*   Each instance of the extension is assumed to have a one-to-one mapping with a single custom icon and webhook URL—there is no support for multiple webhook URLs within one instance.
*   It is assumed that users understand basic Chrome extension interaction, such as right-clicking for options.
*   The environment is assumed to have reliable network conditions for the webhook to receive data, although a retry mechanism is provided for failures.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Simultaneous Instance Interactions:**

    *   Managing multiple instances may lead to conflicts in local storage if not properly segregated.
    *   Ensure robust storage handling so that each instance’s settings remain isolated.

*   **Network Failures & Retry Logic:**

    *   Repeated unsuccessful transmission attempts may lead to user frustration.
    *   Use clear notifications and possibly a cooldown period between retries to mitigate network overload or misinterpretation.

*   **Extension Permissions:**

    *   The extension must strictly adhere to Chrome’s minimal permission requirements.
    *   Any increase in required permissions may impact user trust and extension approval during review.

*   **Icon Customization Constraints:**

    *   Custom icon uploads must conform to Chrome’s requirements (file types, sizes, and resolutions).
    *   Validate icons upon upload to avoid runtime issues or poor user experience.

*   **Service Worker Limitations:**

    *   As the extension uses service workers for background processing, ensure that they are properly managed since service workers have their own lifecycle constraints (e.g., being terminated when idle).

These guidelines should help in creating a clear, practical, and robust extension, ensuring all necessary features, flows, and potential issues are well understood for seamless development and future reference.
