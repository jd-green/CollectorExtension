# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This project is centered around a simple yet effective Chrome extension that streamlines the process of sending web page metadata to a specified webhook. The extension captures important details such as the current URL, the date, time, and basic device information whenever a user clicks on its icon in the Chrome toolbar. With a focus on clarity and ease of use, the extension also supports multiple independent instances, each customizable with a unique icon and individual webhook configuration. The technology chosen for this project is aimed at ensuring a smooth user experience while keeping the application lightweight, secure, and efficient, making it accessible even to users who are not well-versed in technical details.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend of the extension is built using Vanilla JavaScript, with the option to use TypeScript if a more structured approach is desired. The development takes advantage of Chrome's Manifest V3, which is essential for modern Chrome extension development. Manifest V3 brings security and performance improvements by enabling background processing via service workers. The user interface includes a main action popup or icon badge for immediate visual feedback, and a dedicated options page where users can upload custom icons and configure webhook URLs. These technologies work together to deliver a responsive, minimalistic, and user-friendly experience that requires only the essential permissions, thus protecting user privacy.

## Backend Technologies

This project does not incorporate a traditional backend server. Instead, all configuration data and settings are stored locally within the browser using local storage. This approach is ideal for a Chrome extension that performs simple operations such as capturing metadata and sending it to external webhooks. By relying on local storage, the extension maintains configuration persistence across sessions without the complexities of server-side data handling. This design ensures the extension remains lightweight, fast, and secure by minimizing external dependencies and limiting the required permissions to just URL and storage access.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The infrastructure of this extension leverages the Chrome extension framework, which serves as the primary hosting environment. Chromeâ€™s built-in service worker system, part of Manifest V3, handles background tasks such as capturing data and executing retries if a webhook fails to respond. The version control and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, though not heavily emphasized given the project's simplicity, are supported by modern development tools like Cursor. This advanced coding tool provides real-time suggestions and enhancements ensuring code quality and smoother deployment cycles. The combination of local storage for configuration and the robust environment offered by Chrome guarantees that the extension is both scalable for individual use and easily deployable as needed.

## Third-Party Integrations

While the core operation of the project remains self-contained, it does incorporate essential third-party integrations that enhance its functionality. The extension integrates webhooks to forward the captured metadata to external services, making the data immediately actionable. Additionally, development is streamlined by using tools like Cursor, an advanced IDE that supports a real-time coding environment. These integrations are selected for their reliability and ease of use, ensuring that data is transmitted accurately and that developers have a smooth coding experience when building and maintaining the extension.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is a key factor in the choice of technologies for this project. By using Manifest V3, the extension benefits from enhanced security measures such as service worker-based background processing and strict permission controls. Only URL and storage permissions are requested, reducing potential privacy risks and boosting user trust. Performance optimizations include the use of lightweight, client-side coding practices that ensure rapid data capture and transmission. The built-in retry mechanism, which attempts to resend data up to three times in case of a failure, further enhances operational reliability while providing clear visual feedback to the user. These measures collectively ensure that the extension not only protects user data but also delivers a smooth, virtually lag-free experience.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In summary, the technology choices for this Chrome extension have been carefully selected to meet the primary goals of simplicity, efficiency, and user-friendliness. The frontend relies on Vanilla JavaScript (or optionally TypeScript) together with Manifest V3 to offer a cutting-edge yet accessible user interface, while local storage eliminates the need for a conventional backend by handling all configuration settings directly in the browser. The infrastructure is rooted in Chrome's secure and reliable extension ecosystem, integrated with modern development tools like Cursor to ensure code quality and ease of future enhancements. Security and performance have been prioritized by minimizing required permissions and leveraging robust background processing mechanisms, which includes an effective error-handling and retry strategy. Together, these choices provide a powerful and straightforward solution aimed at enhancing productivity while maintaining high standards in security and user experience.
