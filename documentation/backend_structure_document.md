# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document explains the backend structure of our Chrome extension which is designed to streamline sending web page metadata to a designated webhook. Even though the project is primarily a client-side application, the backend components are vital for managing configuration settings, handling data transmission, and ensuring smooth operation. The extension uses a minimalist approach by storing configuration data locally in the browser and relying on Chrome’s built-in capabilities for background processing, ensuring that the overall solution is both lightweight and effective.

## Backend Architecture

The project operates on a client-centric architecture. Instead of a traditional server-based backend, the Chrome extension leverages local storage and service workers provided by Manifest V3. When a user sets up the extension using the options page, details like the webhook URL and custom icon are saved directly into local storage. When the extension icon is clicked, a service worker captures the current URL and metadata, then uses a simple fetch mechanism to communicate with an externally provided webhook. This approach ensures that the application is not only scalable and maintainable but also efficient since it eliminates the need for a dedicated server.

## Database Management

In this project, the role of the database is fulfilled by the browser's local storage. All configuration data such as webhook URLs and custom icons are stored locally, making it easy to manage and retrieve settings. There is no need for complex database management systems since the data is limited in scope and volume. The structure is kept simple with key-value pairs, ensuring that settings remain persistent between browser sessions without adding any complexity or the need for external database servers.

## API Design and Endpoints

The API design in this project is straightforward. There is no traditional RESTful or GraphQL API hosted on a server. Instead, the extension sends metadata to a third-party webhook endpoint provided by the user. This transmission is performed using an HTTP POST request through the fetch API. Each click on the extension icon triggers this operation, and the payload typically includes the current URL, the date, time, and basic device information. The simplicity of the endpoint design supports clear and direct communication between the extension (acting as a client and mini-backend) and the external service waiting to receive the metadata.

## Hosting Solutions

Since the entire operation occurs within the browser environment, hosting the backend involves the Chrome extension ecosystem itself. The extension is distributed and hosted via the Chrome Web Store, taking advantage of Chrome's secure and controlled hosting environment. All background processes are managed by Chrome's service worker framework, which provides reliable workflow execution and robust performance without the need for traditional server hosting. This setup is both cost-effective and inherently scalable, allowing the application to run seamlessly on any compatible browser without additional infrastructure investment.

## Infrastructure Components

The infrastructure is built around the capabilities of the Chrome extension platform. The core components include local storage for configuration settings, service workers for background processing, and the native fetch API to handle communication with external webhooks. Service workers ensure that tasks such as capturing metadata and managing retries occur even when the extension is idle. While there is no need for external load balancers or CDNs, this integrated setup assures a reliable and responsive user experience. Each component works in harmony to process data efficiently and provide immediate visual feedback on success or failure.

## Security Measures

Security is achieved by minimizing permissions and adhering to best practices defined by Chrome’s Manifest V3. The extension explicitly requests only URL and storage access, reducing risks and ensuring user privacy. Communication with webhooks is performed over HTTPS, which encrypts the data in transit. Additionally, by storing sensitive configuration data like webhook URLs locally rather than on remote servers, the risk associated with data breaches is further reduced. Overall, the extension’s security model is designed to be robust yet straightforward, aligning with its lightweight functionality and user privacy requirements.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Without a traditional backend server, monitoring is primarily handled via built-in developer tools and Chrome’s extension debugging features. Service workers log events and errors that can be reviewed through the browser console, enabling quick diagnosis and troubleshooting. Routine checks and updates are made as part of the extension’s maintenance, ensuring it remains compatible with Chrome’s evolving standards and security practices. The minimal architecture simplifies maintenance, allowing developers to focus on ensuring optimal performance and user experience without managing complex server environments.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend structure of this Chrome extension is uniquely tailored to take full advantage of the browser environment. By using local storage for configurations and service workers for background processing, the application eliminates the need for a traditional server-based backend while still delivering reliable, scalable, and secure functionality. Data is captured and transmitted using simple, clear API calls to user-defined webhooks. This straightforward and efficient design not only meets the project’s requirements but also promises easy maintenance and updates, positioning the extension as a robust solution for streamlined web page metadata transmission.
