# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is a simple Chrome extension designed to make it quick and easy to send the current web page's URL and some basic metadata—like date, time, and device information—to a pre-configured webhook when a user clicks on its icon in the Chrome toolbar. The primary goal is to offer a lightweight and hassle-free way for users to forward website data to different endpoints, based on unique configurations. Each instance of the extension is independently configured using a custom icon and webhook URL, ensuring that users can run multiple setups simultaneously without confusion. The use of Manifest V3 ensures that the extension is secure and efficient while keeping permissions minimal by only requesting URL and storage access.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Since this is a Chrome extension, there is no traditional sign-in or sign-up process. When a user installs the extension, they are immediately introduced to the basic setup process without needing to log in with credentials. The onboarding begins when the extension is added to the Chrome toolbar, and the user is prompted to access the options page by right-clicking on the extension icon. Here, they can configure the essential settings for that instance. For users who need to adjust their settings later, the process is just as simple with immediate access to the configuration options. There is no account-based management, so signing out or recovering passwords is not applicable in this context.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

The main interface of this extension is not a traditional dashboard, but rather a quick and subtle interaction model centered around the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. Upon clicking the icon, the extension immediately captures the current page's URL along with its metadata and sends this data to the designated webhook. In addition, each instance of the extension is represented by its own custom icon, which serves as the visual anchor for its configuration. This setup means that once users have installed and configured the extension through the options page, the toolbar icon becomes the primary tool for engaging with the extension’s functionality, with visual confirmation provided directly at the icon level upon action.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The user journey begins when the extension is installed and the options page is accessed via a right-click on the toolbar icon. On the options page, users are guided through the process of uploading a custom icon and entering the webhook URL for that particular instance. Once these settings are saved in local storage, the extension updates the icon shown in the Chrome toolbar, effectively representing that unique configuration. When a user clicks the extension icon in the toolbar, a background process is initiated using the functionality provided by service workers under Manifest V3. The extension then captures the current URL and metadata, compiles this data, and sends it to the pre-configured webhook. On a successful data transmission, a temporary badge (typically a green checkmark) appears over the icon for 10 seconds, giving the user immediate positive feedback. If, however, the data transmission fails, the extension automatically attempts to resend the data up to three times. Should these attempts still fail, a red X badge is displayed for the same duration, along with a notification that includes basic troubleshooting details. This clear series of actions—from configuring the settings to receiving visual feedback on the toolbar—creates a seamless and integrated user experience.

## Settings and Account Management

Even though there is no user account involved, the extension provides an easy and straightforward configuration interface accessible via the options page. Here, users can upload a custom icon, which helps in differentiating between multiple instances, and input the unique webhook URL corresponding to that instance. All the settings required for the extension's functionality are stored in local storage, which ensures that the configurations persist between sessions without the need for an external server or backend. After making changes on the options page, users simply close the settings interface and return to their normal browsing experience, with the assurance that their configurations are active and ready. The options page is designed to be clean and accessible, ensuring that any adjustments or maintenance tasks are straightforward and non-intrusive.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The extension incorporates robust error handling to manage scenarios such as network failures or misconfigurations. If the extension encounters an error while sending data to the webhook, it does not immediately inform the user. Instead, it initiates a built-in retry mechanism that attempts to resend the captured data up to three times. This means that temporary network issues or glitches are managed automatically. However, if all three attempts fail, the extension then brings the issue to the user's attention by displaying a red X badge on the extension icon for 10 seconds. Along with this visual cue, the extension provides additional troubleshooting details to help the user understand what might have gone wrong. This strategy helps maintain a smooth user experience by only alerting the user when there is a persistent problem, rather than interrupting the flow for minor issues.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From installation to everyday use, the user experience is straightforward and efficient. There is no lengthy sign-up process; instead, users are immediately able to configure the extension through the options page accessible via a right-click on the icon. Once set up, each custom icon in the Chrome toolbar represents a standalone configuration that captures the current page's URL and metadata when clicked. The feedback mechanism—showing a temporary green checkmark on success or a red X on failure—ensures that users are always aware of the status of their data transmission. In case of errors, the built-in retry mechanism and clear notifications help users troubleshoot potential issues. Overall, the journey is designed to be minimally disruptive yet maximally effective, ensuring that users of all technical backgrounds can benefit from a simple tool to forward metadata with reliability and clarity.
